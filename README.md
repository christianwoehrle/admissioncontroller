# Admissioncontroller

Just a simple Admissioncontroller with the necessary secrets and config so that the ApiServer can actually call the Controller without TLS Problems.

You can create new certificates with script ```key-creation/create-certificates.sh``` or just use what≈õ in the directory ```key-creation```.

The Files```ca[key|crt]``` form up the certificate authority that is used to sign the server certificate ```admissioncontroller.[key|crt]``` and the client certificate ```client.[key|crt]```.
